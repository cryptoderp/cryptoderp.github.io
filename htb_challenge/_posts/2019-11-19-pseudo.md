## Description 
 Do you have enough permissions to get the flag? We are given an elf aarch64 file

        # file pseudo
        pseudo: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, ARM aarch64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, no section header
## Work
This is an ARM file which requires qemu to emulate the right environment, ARM files are used for microprocessors as it is an Acorn Computers file for Archimedes Computers. I used qemu stretch arm64 as well as gef for GDB (https://discourse.osmc.tv/t/howto-emulating-debian-stretch-arm64-on-a-x86-64-linux-host/70389)

Then confiure the qemu run script 

```bash
#!/bin/bash

qemu-system-aarch64 \
-smp 2 \
-m 1024 \
-M virt \
-cpu cortex-a57 \
-bios /usr/share/qemu-efi-aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd \
-nographic \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=image \
-drive if=none,id=image,file=ubuntu-16.04-server-cloudimg-arm64-uefi1.img,format=qcow2 \
-device virtio-blk-device,drive=cloud \
-drive if=none,id=cloud,file=cloud.img,format=qcow2 \
-device e1000,netdev=net0 \
-netdev user,id=net0,hostfwd=tcp:127.0.0.1:2222-:22
```
Load that qemu then login to the image, move the file over using scp

Looks like there is UPX packing which can be unpacked with upx

Now open with gdb/gef

Set a breakpoint and run the program
 
        set break point *0x0000000000400b38
        r

Eventually you will get the password to execute the program which reveals the flag...the terminal must be maximized else you will get an alert saying "The terminal is for ants"
