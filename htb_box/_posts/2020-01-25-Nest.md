## Enumeration 
This box looks to be a moderately difficult Windows box using SMB and .Net reversing for privesc

Using autorecon and manually enumerating for a starting point
  
    python3 ../_tools/Autorecon/autorecon.py -vv 10.10.10.178

Which found smb ports and enumerated the shares

## Exploits - Work

We can access the SMB share Data as null 

    smbclient ////10.10.10.178/Data -U null

Access the SMB share Data as TempUser

After digging around I found IT/Configs/RU Scanner/RU_config.xml which contains 

```xml
<Username>c.smith</Username>
  <Password>fTEzAfYDoz1YzkqhQkH6GQFYKp1XY5hm7bjOP86yYxE=</Password>
```

Also found another config.xml at IT\Configs\NotepadPlusPlus\config.xml which has the following path detail

```xml
 <History nbMaxFile="15" inSubMenu="no" customLength="-1">
        <File filename="C:\windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts" />
        <File filename="\\HTB-NEST\Secure$\IT\Carl\Temp.txt" />
        <File filename="C:\Users\C.Smith\Desktop\todo.txt" />
```

TempUser cannot access Secure/IT but can acess Secure\IT\Carl
Dump the directory locally

    smbclient -U TempUser \\\\10.10.10.178\\secure$
    cd IT
    cd Carl

Using the project obtained you can decode the password by script or by cyberchef

![](/htb_box/img/2020-01-27-19-36-51.png)

Then AES using that as the key and the IV is 464R5DFA5DL6LE28 UTF-8
